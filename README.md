Python Turtle Project

*Description*

This project combines Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics to create dynamic designs and an interactive Among Us voting simulation.

1. Colorful Turtle Patterns: Using Turtle, this project generates animated geometric patterns with colors that shift smoothly through the spectrum. The colors change by manipulating the hue in the HSV model, creating a visually engaging and interactive experience.

2. Among Us Voting Simulation: Inspired by the popular game, this project simulates an emergency meeting where players vote to eject someone as the impostor. A stylized Turtle graphic of a crewmate is drawn, and the program randomly decides if the chosen player is the impostor. The result is displayed in a fun, game-like format.

-Both projects highlight creative uses of Turtle graphics, blending vibrant patterns with an interactive game simulation to create a unique and engaging coding experience.
